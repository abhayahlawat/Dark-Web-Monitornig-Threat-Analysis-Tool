# Dark Web Monitoring and Threat Analysis

## Overview

The **Dark Web Monitoring and Threat Analysis** project is a Python-based tool designed to monitor the dark web for exposed or compromised data. It helps individuals and organizations identify potential threats, such as stolen credentials, personal information leaks, and cybercriminal activities, before they result in a security breach.

This project scans dark web sources like forums, marketplaces, and hidden services, and analyzes the data to provide detailed reports on potential threats. It offers features like real-time alerts, threat intelligence, and the ability to trace leaked or compromised information.

## Features

- **Continuous Dark Web Scanning**: Monitors hidden websites, forums, and marketplaces for leaked sensitive data (e.g., personal details, passwords, email addresses).
- **Real-Time Alerts**: Provides instant alerts when sensitive data is found on the dark web.
- **Threat Analysis**: Analyzes detected threats, including the type of data exposed and the potential impact on users or organizations.
- **Keyword Monitoring**: Monitors specific keywords like email addresses, usernames, or company names for potential exposure.
- **Integration with Security Tools**: Can be integrated into existing SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) systems for streamlined cybersecurity efforts.
- **Historical Threat Data**: Tracks and reports any detected threats in a historical context for improved investigation and incident response.
